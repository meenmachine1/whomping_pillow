# Operation Take Back Beanbag Chair

Are your coworkers sitting in your beanbag chair? Does someone from managment named Steve constantly send you pictures late at night of them violating your bean bag chair?

With a flex force sensor, rpi 4, rpi pico, and a speaker, you can take back what is rightfully yours.

## Q&A

Q: Why do you use a pico instead of an ADC? Why didn't you just ask them to stop sitting in your chair? Why do you care so much about this? This is a fast track to getting fired. This is the dumbest idea I've ever seen in my life. Why are you like this? Don't you know your parents hate you?

A: All valid questions. I didn't realize that the rpi 4 didn't have an ADC and I was too lazy to find an ADC. So the pico reads the sensor and sends it over UART. Not the cleanest solution but you gotta make do with what you've got. Also I agree with everything else.
